The group of girls gradually morphed into becoming Destiny's Child, one of the most successful female recording groups of all-time. Destiny's Child amassed worldwide hits with both singles and albums and in 2001 BEYONC√â became the first African-American woman and the second woman ever to take home the ASCAP Pop Songwriter of the Year Award for her work with the band. Following her success with Destiny's Child and making the change to becoming a solo artist, BEYONC√â has become one of the defining artists of our generation. A singer, songwriter, performer, actor, filmmaker, Beyonc√© is a creative tour-de-force who has captivated, astonished and is celebrated by the world.")

It is a midtempo R&B ballad accompanied by piano, strings, and drum machine beats. The lyrics describe heartache and the insecurities of love.",

After several years of development, Lamar hit his creative and chart-topping stride in the 2010s. Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012), the Grammy-winning To Pimp a Butterfly (2015), and the Grammy- and Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN. (2017), his three proper major-label albums, have displayed an unmatched mix of inventive wordplay and compelling conceptual narratives, examining internal conflict, flaunting success, and uplifting his community. The screenplay-level detail of Lamar's writing has been enriched by a collective of producers, instrumentalists, singers, and rappers, a high percentage of whom ‚Äî including inspirations Dr. Dre and MC Eiht, and contemporaries Sounwave and Jay Rock ‚Äî represent Lamar's native Los Angeles. Lamar's cinematic and collaborative inclinations inevitably attracted the mainstream film industry. Black Panther: The Album (2018) was the source of three of Lamar's Top Ten pop hits. In 2022 he delivered Mr. Morale, the Big Steppers, his fifth studio album and what would be his last with Top Dawg Entertainment.")

A singer and songwriter whose artful output has defied rigid classification as R&B, he has nonetheless pushed that genre forward with seemingly offhanded yet imaginatively detailed narratives in which he has alternated between yearning romantic and easygoing braggart. Known first as a writer and Odd Future affiliate, Ocean made his solo debut with Novacane (2011), a single regarding a fling that could be read, in part, as a criticism of commercial radio, yet it found a home on mainstream urban playlists and went platinum. Despite further strained relations with music industry machinations, Channel Orange (2012), his first proper album, nearly crowned the Billboard 200 and made him a Grammy winner. When Ocean left the major-label system, his commercial clout was greater than ever, as demonstrated by the chart-topping success of Blonde (2016). His recordings since then amount to a short album's worth of singles including the platinum Chanel (2017) and the simultaneously-issued Dear April and Cayendo (2020).")

Capping off her whirlwind breakthrough era, she became the first solo female rapper to win a Grammy for Best Rap Album.

Like many of her contemporaries, she was a talented vocalist trained as a powerful gospel belter, but she set herself apart with her songwriting ability, magnetic stage presence, and shrewd choice of studio collaborators, all of which resulted in sustained success. During the '70s alone, she topped the Billboard club chart 11 times with high-quality, often high-concept material that included the rapturous Love to Love You Baby (1975), the innovative I Feel Love (1977), a radically transformed MacArthur Park (1978), and one of her five Grammy-winning recordings, Hot Stuff (1979). These crossover hits embodied the disco era with audacious musicality and uninhibited eroticism. After her subgenre was declared dead, Summer was very much part of the evolution of dance music. Through the feminist anthem She Works Hard for the Money (1983), she became an MTV star, and she continued to top the club chart with disco-rooted house singles through 2010, 35 years after her breakthrough. Summer died from cancer in 2012 and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame the next year.")

The potential the singer and songwriter displayed on early recordings with the likes of SBTRKT, Sampha, and Joker reached fruition with Devotion (2012), her Top Ten U.K., Mercury Prize-nominated debut. By the end of the decade, she had two additional and distinctive full-lengths, Tough Love (2014) and Glasshouse (2017), that fared equally well with smoldering ballads favored over supple grooves. She has since issued her fourth LP, What's Your Pleasure? (2020), packed with discofied floor-fillers. Amid all the success, Ware has remained a serial collaborator. Bobby Womack, Disclosure, HAIM, Nicki Minaj, and Ed Sheeran are among those who have sought her songwriting and/or vocal assistance.")

In his prime, Jackson was an unstoppable juggernaut, possessed of all the tools to dominate the charts seemingly at will: an instantly identifiable voice, eye-popping dance moves, stunning musical versatility, and loads of sheer star power.

The song continues with several sexual plays on the words 'rock' and 'rocket' as the singer describes making love with her husband. Beyonc√© said on the documentary about the making of her album that she decided to make honesty the glue that holds it together, a principle that guided this sexual cut. What I love about this song is it takes you through this journey, the songstress said. You're talking and you're flirting and you're talking all of this arrogant s‚Äî. Then you climax and then you have your cigarette.",

Though famous for her disco work at the time, this song is a ballad and was released as a single in certain countries in 1977.[1] However, the B-side, I Feel Love caused such a stir that it was replaced as the A-side and became a landmark song in disco. Still, this song made it to #20 on the R&B chart, the first time one of her singles had done so since Love to Love You Baby.",

    about: "Jessie, via Apple Music: 'There's an almost hypnotic element to this song. It's very dark, almost like the end of the night when things are potentially getting too loose. It's also a difficult one to talk about. It's about someone feeling like they know you well‚Äîmaybe too well. There are anxieties in there, and it's meant to be cinematic. I wanted that relentlessly driving feeling like you'd be in a car and you just keep going on, like you're almost running away from something. Again, Jules Buckley did an amazing job with the strings here‚ÄîI wanted it to sound almost like it was verging on Primal Scream or Massive Attack. And live, it could just build and build and build. There is, though, a lightness at the end of it, and an optimism‚Äîlike you're clawing your way out of this darkness.'",

Everything that could be going wrong was going wrong, which is behind the lyric 'The heart of the city is on fire.' And it sounds relatively upbeat, but actually, it's about me thinking, 'Remember where you are. Remember that just a cuddle can be okay. Remember who's around you.' Also, it was very much a semi-sign-off and about saying, 'This is where I'm going and this is the most confident I've ever been.' It was a bold statement. I think it stands up as one of the best songs I've ever written.'",

Other aspects of this track include religion, which Lamar claims lifted him out of writer's block to create this album.",

        about: "Can't We Just Sit Down (And Talk It Over) is a song originally done by southern soul singer Bill Brandon on his only one self-titled album from 1977, recorded on Prelude Records and then covered by American singer Donna Summer from her album I Remember Yesterday. Though famous for her disco work at the time, this song is a ballad and was released as a single in certain countries in 1977.[1] However, the B-side, I Feel Love caused such a stir that it was replaced as the A-side and became a landmark song in disco. Still, this song made it to #20 on the R&B chart, the first time one of her singles had done so since Love to Love You Baby.",

It's sex, it's desire, it's temptation. We were like, 'Let's do this as outrageously as possible.' So we imagined we were this incredibly confident person who could just say anything. When we wrote it, it just came out‚Äî20 minutes and then it was done. James came up with that amazing beat, which almost reminds me of a DJ Shadow song. We were giggling the whole time we were writing it. It's quite poppy accidentally, but I think with the darkness of all the synths, it's just the perfect combination'.",

The song takes its name from the homonymous cocktail, which in Spanish would be translated as 'Moscow mule' -which despite referring to the Russian city, is of American origin. The moscow mule is a preparation that contains vodka, lemon juice, ginger beer and a whole lemon, and is consumed in a cup made of copper, which gives it its characteristic appearance. This cocktail is easily associated with hot seasons, being considered 'the most refreshing summer'.",

            The instrumental is pretty much inspired by a punk trap, with a fast rhythm that intensifies as the seconds go by. An important ingredient is the guitars in the last part of the song, which manage to mark the change of rhythm and convey the feeling of self-destruction that prevails throughout the song.",

            In the Instagram post, the Puerto Rican appears in a new Chiron Sport 110 ANS Bugatti, a car valued at more than $3,260,000 (USD).

            The theme is the third collaboration that brings together both artists, however it is the first that is not a remix, since they had previously coincided in 'No Me Conoce (Remix)' and 'C√ìMO SE SIENTE (REMIX)'.

            The name 'Dakiti' comes from a pub with the same name located in San Juan, Puerto Rico.",

            Unlike the aforementioned theme, in this song he does not sing about heartbreak, but instead makes it visible that he is a faithful believer in reciprocated love and reveals one of his most intimate sides regarding this feeling.

            Accompanied by a guitar and futuristic sounds inspired by nature, Benito recounts a journey through space, in which, embarked on a special ship, he travels through the planets that make up our Solar System, the Moon and has contact with extraterrestrial beings, always looking for his requited love. His desire to find it is so strong that he even expresses that he would wander through the universe, traveling billions of kilometers to find it.",

            about: "In 'SORRY PAPI', Bad Bunny returns to compose a song in which a woman is the protagonist and seeks to highlight her empowered position in the face of constant pressure from men. This comes after having released 'Yo Perreo Sola', which vindicates the position of power of women in the disco, and which became one of the most iconic songs of 2020.

            In the song, ABRA takes on the role of a woman whom Benito wants, and the entire song develops almost like a dialogue between the two, in which the Puerto Rican seeks to seduce her and achieve something with her through different methods, such as flattering her and offer her luxuries, reaching the point of idolizing her and considering her as his goddess.",

            about: "'120' is presented as one of the songs with the simplest structure of the record project, since it only consists of a very brief intro, a verse and an outro, spending a significant amount of seconds to highlight the music track.

            The track begins with clear synthwave sounds, with hints of R&B and a low tempo. In the verse, this style evolves and trap is incorporated, which ends up giving the theme Bad Bunny's personality and characteristic touch.

            The song takes place on a car trip, and this serves as the main source of inspiration, since references to automobile makes and models abound, of course without neglecting the basketball references that characterize the Puerto Rican. At the end of the verse, the sound of a car is incorporated, which probably belong to the Bugatti Chiron Sport '110 Ans Bugatti' that the artist acquired in October 2020.",

            This journey is made without losing its essence, since the beat is a kind of happy trap, which remains faithful to the rhythm and kicks of this genre, but adds elements of future bass, electronic music and a little nod to reggaeton to the end of the second verse. All these elements as a whole manage to form a kind of joyful and hopeful trap, similar to what 'We're Good' was.",

            The theme is a Christmas and New Year's song, accompanied by guitars and percussion, among which the congas stand out. In addition to this, in the lyrics the interpreters contrast the way in which rich people and poor people live Christmas, stating that for some it is a time of happiness and for others of sadness.
