The group of girls gradually morphed into becoming Destiny's Child, one of the most successful female recording groups of all-time. Destiny's Child amassed worldwide hits with both singles and albums and in 2001 BEYONC√â became the first African-American woman and the second woman ever to take home the ASCAP Pop Songwriter of the Year Award for her work with the band. Following her success with Destiny's Child and making the change to becoming a solo artist, BEYONC√â has become one of the defining artists of our generation. A singer, songwriter, performer, actor, filmmaker, Beyonc√© is a creative tour-de-force who has captivated, astonished and is celebrated by the world.")

Gliding smoothly over a cascading beat, Bey waxes poetic in a mesmerizing falsetto about the imperfection of her and her lover. Lush and rich, with basslines and synths reminiscent of sounds from the '20s, No Angel demonstrates a vulnerability in Beyonc√©'s usually rock solid attitude towards her partners: she still loves this guy even though he's not perfect, even if he makes mistakes. It offers a more human version of Beyonc√©, and adds a degree of rawness and genuineness to how she portrays relationships.",

The song was released one day after what would have been Trayvon Martin's 21st birthday and one day before what would have been Sandra Bland's 29th birthday. Martin and Bland's deaths are focal points of Black Lives Matter.",
