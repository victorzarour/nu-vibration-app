The group of girls gradually morphed into becoming Destiny's Child, one of the most successful female recording groups of all-time. Destiny's Child amassed worldwide hits with both singles and albums and in 2001 BEYONCÉ became the first African-American woman and the second woman ever to take home the ASCAP Pop Songwriter of the Year Award for her work with the band. Following her success with Destiny's Child and making the change to becoming a solo artist, BEYONCÉ has become one of the defining artists of our generation. A singer, songwriter, performer, actor, filmmaker, Beyoncé is a creative tour-de-force who has captivated, astonished and is celebrated by the world.")

Lizzo lived in Detroit until she was ten, when she and her family moved to Houston. While growing up, she listened to gospel at home, took flute lessons with the respected music teacher Claudia Momen, and played in her school's marching band. She also began rapping, forming the group Cornrow Clique with her friends when she was 14. Around this time, she picked up the nickname Lizzo, a cross between 'Lissa' and Jay-Z's 'Izzo (H.O.V. A.).'")

Her involvement in a Broadway play at age 15, followed by some small TV parts, helped her land the role of Cat on TV's Victorious. She followed that with the spinoff Sam, Cat and then dove headfirst into a chart-topping musical career.")

After signing with Def Jam in 2005, she soon gained recognition with the release of her first two studio albums, Music of the Sun (2005) and A Girl Like Me (2006), both of which were influenced by Caribbean music and peaked within the top ten of the US Billboard 200 chart.")

He rarely showed his face and never spoke outside the music that peppered his 2011 mixtape trilogy, House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence. But that changed when Drake's cosign led to his major-label debut, Kiss Land, in 2013. His follow-up, Beauty Behind the Madness, made him a star with singles like Earned It, Can't Feel My Face, and The Hills. His third album, Starboy, with its title track appearance from Daft Punk, cemented his status as one of the most visible pop stars in the world.")

kendrick = Artist.create(name: "Kendrick Lamar", image: "https://resources.tidal.com/images/f081ffab/8fba/4989/9043/9823518b6db3/750x750.jpg", bio: "Indisputably the most acclaimed rap artist of his generation, Kendrick Lamar is one of those rare MCs who has achieved critical and commercial success while earning the respect and support of those who inspired him. After several years of development, Lamar hit his creative and chart-topping stride in the 2010s. Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012), the Grammy-winning To Pimp a Butterfly (2015), and the Grammy- and Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN. (2017), his three proper major-label albums, have displayed an unmatched mix of inventive wordplay and compelling conceptual narratives, examining internal conflict, flaunting success, and uplifting his community. The screenplay-level detail of Lamar's writing has been enriched by a collective of producers, instrumentalists, singers, and rappers, a high percentage of whom — including inspirations Dr. Dre and MC Eiht, and contemporaries Sounwave and Jay Rock — represent Lamar's native Los Angeles. Lamar's cinematic and collaborative inclinations inevitably attracted the mainstream film industry. Black Panther: The Album (2018) was the source of three of Lamar's Top Ten pop hits. In 2022 he delivered Mr. Morale, the Big Steppers, his fifth studio album and what would be his last with Top Dawg Entertainment.")

A singer and songwriter whose artful output has defied rigid classification as R&B, he has nonetheless pushed that genre forward with seemingly offhanded yet imaginatively detailed narratives in which he has alternated between yearning romantic and easygoing braggart. Known first as a writer and Odd Future affiliate, Ocean made his solo debut with Novacane (2011), a single regarding a fling that could be read, in part, as a criticism of commercial radio, yet it found a home on mainstream urban playlists and went platinum. Despite further strained relations with music industry machinations, Channel Orange (2012), his first proper album, nearly crowned the Billboard 200 and made him a Grammy winner. When Ocean left the major-label system, his commercial clout was greater than ever, as demonstrated by the chart-topping success of Blonde (2016). His recordings since then amount to a short album's worth of singles including the platinum Chanel (2017) and the simultaneously-issued Dear April and Cayendo (2020).")

After an initial run of singles that crowned her the first female rapper in nearly two decades to top the Billboard Hot 100 (with Bodak Yellow), she issued her critically acclaimed debut album, 2018's Invasion of Privacy, which reached number one and broke additional records with the summer smash I Like It. Capping off her whirlwind breakthrough era, she became the first solo female rapper to win a Grammy for Best Rap Album. Heading into the next decade, Cardi continued to dominate with chart-topping singles like 2020's WAP with Megan Thee Stallion and 2021's Up.")

dua = Artist.create(name: "Dua Lipa", image: "https://resources.tidal.com/images/d27e08fb/7699/4c89/8b6b/ee8dae4842f7/750x750.jpg", bio: "English pop singer Dua Lipa showcases a throwback vibe and a knack for catchy pop with soulful grit, much like Sia, Jessie J, or P!nk, and a slyly rebellious air like Charli XCX or Marina, the Diamonds. After a steady rise in the U.K., she broke onto the U.S. charts with a series of collaborations with Sean Paul, Martin Garrix, and Calvin Harris, as well as multi-platinum singles New Rules and IDGAF from her 2017 debut, Dua Lipa. Still riding the high from her breakthrough, she won 2019 Grammy Awards for Best New Artist and Best Dance Recording for her collaboration with Silk City, Electricity. The following year, she hit new highs with her chart-topping, Grammy-winning sophomore album, the club-inspired Future Nostalgia.")

donna = Artist.create(name: "Donna Summer", image: "https://resources.tidal.com/images/8abc8b11/9c5a/489c/ba35/7e1c3978998b/750x750.jpg", bio: "Donna Summer's title as the Queen of Disco wasn't mere hype. Like many of her contemporaries, she was a talented vocalist trained as a powerful gospel belter, but she set herself apart with her songwriting ability, magnetic stage presence, and shrewd choice of studio collaborators, all of which resulted in sustained success. During the '70s alone, she topped the Billboard club chart 11 times with high-quality, often high-concept material that included the rapturous Love to Love You Baby (1975), the innovative I Feel Love (1977), a radically transformed MacArthur Park (1978), and one of her five Grammy-winning recordings, Hot Stuff (1979). These crossover hits embodied the disco era with audacious musicality and uninhibited eroticism. After her subgenre was declared dead, Summer was very much part of the evolution of dance music. Through the feminist anthem She Works Hard for the Money (1983), she became an MTV star, and she continued to top the club chart with disco-rooted house singles through 2010, 35 years after her breakthrough. Summer died from cancer in 2012 and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame the next year.")

jessie = Artist.create(name: "Jessie Ware", image: "https://resources.tidal.com/images/968c6518/e10a/476f/b5ca/9b12716be7bd/750x750.jpg", bio: "An assortment of guest appearances and solo singles in the early 2010s situated Jessie Ware in a line of sophisticated U.K. soul and left-field luminaries ranging from Sade Adu, Lisa Stansfield, and Caron Wheeler to Tracey Thorn and Róisín Murphy. The potential the singer and songwriter displayed on early recordings with the likes of SBTRKT, Sampha, and Joker reached fruition with Devotion (2012), her Top Ten U.K., Mercury Prize-nominated debut. By the end of the decade, she had two additional and distinctive full-lengths, Tough Love (2014) and Glasshouse (2017), that fared equally well with smoldering ballads favored over supple grooves. She has since issued her fourth LP, What's Your Pleasure? (2020), packed with discofied floor-fillers. Amid all the success, Ware has remained a serial collaborator. Bobby Womack, Disclosure, HAIM, Nicki Minaj, and Ed Sheeran are among those who have sought her songwriting and/or vocal assistance.")

michael = Artist.create(name: "Michael Jackson", image: "https://resources.tidal.com/images/1493c264/d68a/4415/9013/2c913f2edf14/750x750.jpg", bio: "Michael Jackson was unquestionably the biggest pop star of the late 20th century, and certainly one of the most popular recording artists of all time. In his prime, Jackson was an unstoppable juggernaut, possessed of all the tools to dominate the charts seemingly at will: an instantly identifiable voice, eye-popping dance moves, stunning musical versatility, and loads of sheer star power. His 1982 blockbuster Thriller became the biggest-selling album of all time (probably his best-known accomplishment), and he was the first black artist to find stardom on MTV, breaking down innumerable boundaries both for his race and for music video as an art form.")

Dedicated to Jay and her fans, the track describes the reliability of their love for her and how much she appreciates it.

Though famous for her disco work at the time, this song is a ballad and was released as a single in certain countries in 1977.[1] However, the B-side, I Feel Love caused such a stir that it was replaced as the A-side and became a landmark song in disco. Still, this song made it to #20 on the R&B chart, the first time one of her singles had done so since Love to Love You Baby.",

It's sex, it's desire, it's temptation. We were like, 'Let's do this as outrageously as possible.' So we imagined we were this incredibly confident person who could just say anything. When we wrote it, it just came out—20 minutes and then it was done. James came up with that amazing beat, which almost reminds me of a DJ Shadow song. We were giggling the whole time we were writing it. It's quite poppy accidentally, but I think with the darkness of all the synths, it's just the perfect combination'.",

This song charted in the top 10 in the US and helped Jackson became the first man to have four top 10 singles from the same album. The song was written by Rod Temperton, the same man who wrote Thriller.",

But what's most beautiful about 'No Tears Left to Cry' is that it doesn't ignore the pain she went through; it digests the healing it took for her to restart her life after she experienced tragedy.",

In this way, the artist mocks and infantilizes in a funny tone the criticism she receives.",

This nostalgia evokes towards him when looking at the photos with her and thinking about moments like sex, walks together and the first times they were intimate.

            Upon reaching the conclusion that he does not have enough money, Benito begins to reflect and criticizes the current educational system and the saturation of the labor market that affects recent graduates.

She accompanies them with good wishes for her partner and wishes him to find the happiness he lost, which is why he considers that, because of all the damage he caused her, the best thing she can do is forget him forever.
            The guitar is a great ally on this occasion, since in addition to giving strength and attitude to the track, it highlights the sadness that Bad Bunny seeks to express, bringing it closer to the emo trap genre that achieved great notoriety from the year 2016 thanks to rappers like Lil Peep, XXXTENTACION and Juice WRLD.",

            Despite being aware of all this, Bad Bunny confesses to having an uncontrollable addiction for her, making it impossible for him to get away from her, so he falls into something similar to the vicious circle of consumption that traps drug addicts.

            about: "'CANTARES DE NAVIDAD' is an old song by the Trio Vegabajeño, an iconic Puerto Rican popular music trio. This song was originally composed in 1952. It can be found released on the market in 1999, as part of the album Clásicos de Puerto Rico, Vol. 4.
            The theme is a Christmas and New Year's song, accompanied by guitars and percussion, among which the congas stand out. In addition to this, in the lyrics the interpreters contrast the way in which rich people and poor people live Christmas, stating that for some it is a time of happiness and for others of sadness.
            This is the only theme from a Bad Bunny album in which he has no participation.",
